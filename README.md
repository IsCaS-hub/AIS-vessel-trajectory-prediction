# AIS-vessel-trajectory-prediction
Extra materials of the paper "Learning to Predict Trajectories with Destinations from Massive Vessel Data", including code and data.

The raw AIS dataset used in this experiment is sourced from AccessAIS, bounded by the latitude in [-65.644, -65.221] and longitude in [18.069, 18.363]

The code includes data processing and multiple deep learning models mentioned in the paper.
